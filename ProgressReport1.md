# Progress Report 1
## Summary of Work Completed
Met with Philips looked at some project ideas with the grouop.  As a group we decided that our general interest would be a problem involving AI.  Since we just got our group assignments today, we decided that each of us should look into our top 3 AI related projects and then report them in our next meeting.  We then plan to rank these projects we picked and present why we think this is the right project for us.  Since we have only had one afternoon since we started this is all we have done at the current moment.
